I"g<h1>Design and Manufacturing II</h1>

<p>In teams of 5, students were tasked with designing and manufacturing 50 yoyos. Our team created the Sno-yo: a yoyo that doubled as a snow globe. The clear cover and white stand are thermoformed while the yoyo body, and snowman components are injection molded. Through this project, I learned how to design for manufacturing, make considerations for mass production, and balance the concepts of rate, time, quality, and flexibility when it comes to organizing a manufacturing process.</p>
