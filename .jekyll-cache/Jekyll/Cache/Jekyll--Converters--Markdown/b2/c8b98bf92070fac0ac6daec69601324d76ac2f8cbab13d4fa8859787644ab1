I" <h1>2.007: Design and Manufacturing I</h1>

<p>â€‹â€‹2.007 is the first of two Design and Manufacturing classes in the mechanical engineering department, and the class is structured around a robotics competition at the end of the semester. Students worked with energy storage and materials constraints, and they were given a range of actions that score varying amounts of points with the goal of maximizing points earned in a given period.</p>

<p>â€‹â€‹â€‹This was an individual project. I constructed comparison charts and prototypes to make design decisions, drafted CADs on Solidworks, and manufactured the robot with a combination of shop machines and tools. During the tournament, my robot drove up a ramp, activated an elevator, and spun a flywheel on the second floor of the gameboard. I placed in the top 8 of the tournament bracket.</p>
