I"¬<h1>Convex Optimization</h1>

<p>As part of a convex optimization course, a classmate and I implemented multi-agent trajectory optimization. In the example below, each agent has a required initial and final location and must traverse between the two locations without colliding with one another. In addition, the trajectory for each vehicle must be dynamically feasible. Each image shows the locations of the vehicles at a particular time, and in each image the full path for all vehicles is drawn.</p>
