I"<h1>MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team</h1>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/sevt/parking lot.jpg" alt="" /></span>​SEVT is a student-run team that designs, builds, and races solar cars. Small but highly motivated, we made just about everything in-house and self-managed all technical, financial, and logistical elements of being a race team.</p>

<p>​​I coordinated with the Mechanical, Aerodynamics/Composites, and Electrical team leaders to integrate all three sub-systems, and I supervised all ongoing projects to ensure progress was being maintained. I provided guidance, instruction, or hands on assistance depending on the situation, and I often did backfilling when members were unable to complete projects. I placed orders for all components/stock and often was responsible for sourcing parts/materials for projects.</p>
