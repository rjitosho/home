I"<h1>Mechatronics: Smart Product Design</h1>

<p>ME218 is a series of Mechatronics courses spanning multiple quarters, with each quarter culminating in a project that combines mechanical, electrical, and software design. The first project was to create an interactive arcade game and the second was to compete in a one-on-one robotics competition. In these projects, I was responsible for designing, implementing, and testing multiple modules of the software and electronic circuits, and I contributed to the system level hardware designs.</p>

<p>Project details can be found at the following websites: <a href="https://218afarmpotato.weebly.com/">218A</a> and <a href="https://traktor218b.weebly.com/">218B</a></p>
