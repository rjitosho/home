I"Å<h1>In-Hand Manipulation</h1>

<p>I interned with the robotics team at Honda Research Institute in the summer of 2021. The robotics team developed a hierarchical framework for planning and control of in-hand manipulation of a rigid object. The high-level planner determines the object trajectory as well as the grasp changes (i.e. adding or removing finger contacts), and these are passed to the low-level controller. My role was to implement sliding as an additional method for changing the grasp. This work was presented at the 2023 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, and is available online <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10040">here</a>.</p>
