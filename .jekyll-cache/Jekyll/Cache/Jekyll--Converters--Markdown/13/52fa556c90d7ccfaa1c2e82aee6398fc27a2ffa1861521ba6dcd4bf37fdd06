I"Å<h1>Robotics: Science and Systems</h1>

<p>In a project-based course, teams implemented a wide range of skills essential to robotics. The course covered content including dynamics and control, vision and sensing, localization and SLAM, as well as path planning and decision-making. Projects were executed both in simulation with ROS as well as on a physical system: a miniature vehicle equipped with a camera, LIDAR, and odometry instrumentation. By the end of the semester, our team developed algorithms that enabled the vehicle to successfully navigate around the basement hallways in a time-based challenge, as well as navigate in a small scale traffic system.</p>
