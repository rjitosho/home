<h1>Hybrid Aerial/Ground Vehicle</h1>

In the summer of 2019, I interned at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). I worked on multiple robotics R&D projects, one of which was a vehicle capable of both driving and flying. I was responsible for the completion of the prototype design and fabrication, which included collaborating with team members as well as leading sensor integration, electronics packaging, and wire harnessing of the vehicle.
