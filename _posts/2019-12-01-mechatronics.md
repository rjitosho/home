<h1>Mechatronics: Smart Product Design</h1>

ME218 is a series of Mechatronics courses spanning multiple quarters, with each quarter culminating in project that combines mechanical, electrical, and software design. The first project was to create an interactive arcade game and the second was to compete in a one-on-one robotics competition. In these projects, I was responsible for designing, implementing, and testing multiple modules of the software and electronic circuits, and I contributed to the system level hardware designs.

Project details can be found at the following websites: [218A](https://218afarmpotato.weebly.com/) and [218B](https://traktor218b.weebly.com/)
