<h2>Soft Robotics</h2>

<p>â€‹Proof-of-concept actuator for the locomotion of a pneumatic, bio-inspired epidermal soft robot.</p>

<p>At the MIT Media Lab, I developed the locomotion mechanism for an epidermal robot able to traverse the surface of human skin. I designed a silicone actuator for bending in 3 directions, developed the fabrication methods, and implemented the electronic controls.</p>
