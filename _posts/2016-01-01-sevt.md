<h2>MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team</h2>

<p>​We are a student-run team that designs, builds, and races solar cars. Small but highly motivated, we make just about everything in-house and self-manage all technical, financial, and logistical elements of being a race team.</p>

<p>​​I coordinate with the Mechanical, Aerodynamics/Composites, and Electrical team leaders to ensure all three systems will be able to integrate together, and I oversee all ongoing projects to ensure progress is being maintained. I provide guidance, instruction, or hands on assistance depending on the situation, and I often do backfilling when members are unable to complete projects. I place orders for all components/stock and often am responsible for sourcing parts/materials for projects.</p>
