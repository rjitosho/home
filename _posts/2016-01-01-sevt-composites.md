<h2>SEVT Composites Layups</h2>

<p>Our team spent 5 weekends constructing both halves of the shell of the car, the chassis, and integrating the chassis with the lower body, all of which was composites work. The upper body was constructed via a wet layup with Kevlar, and the lower body was made via a dry layup with carbon fiber prepreg. Although carbon fiber is stronger, we used Kevlar for the upper body because it is an insulating material and there are many wires for the solar array that run along the upper body. We constructed the chassis with carbon fiber panel then integrated it with carbon fiber to the lower body.</p>

<p>​​​I trained new members on best practices for working with composites. I worked with another member to do the layup for the canopy, and I assisted with laying up the upper and lower body, making chassis panels, assembling the chassis, inserting hard points, strengthening the driver pod, and creating fixtures to hold parts in place while curing.</p>
