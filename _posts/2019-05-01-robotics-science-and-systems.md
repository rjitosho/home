<h2>Robotics: Science and Systems</h2>

<p>In a project-based course, teams implemented a wide range of skills essential to robotics. The course covered content including dynamics and control, vision and sensing, localization and SLAM, as well as path planning and decision-making. Projects were executed both in simulation with ROS as well as on a physical system: a miniature vehicle equipped with a camera, LIDAR, and odometry instrumentation. By the end of the semester, our team developed algorithms that enabled the vehicle to successfully navigate around the basement hallways in a time-based challenge, as well as navigate in a small scale traffic system.</p>

<p>Below are some of the capabilities implemented during labs in this course:</p>
â€‹
<b>Wall Following:</b>
<p>Vehicle Dynamics</p>
<p>PID Controls</p>

<b>Vision and Visual Servoing: </b>
<p>Line following via color segmentation
<p>Transforming pixels to a plane via homography
<p>Object detection with You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm paired with the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset

<b>Localization & SLAM: </b>
<p>Motion and sensor model</p> 
<p>Proprioception based on odometry</p>
<p>Monte carlo localization (particle filter)</p>

<b>Planning & Trajectory Following: </b>
<p>Search based A\*</p>
<p>Sample based rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT)</p>
