<h1>Autonomous Boat</h1>

<p>â€‹Collaborating with two other team members, I developed an autonomous boat capable of maintaining any desired heading. My contributions included designing the electromechanical control feedback system including sensors and actuators as well as designing the housing and waterproofing of electronics within the hull.</p>
