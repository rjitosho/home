<h2>Product Engineering</h2>

<p>This Product Engineering course covers many phases of product development including idea generation, market research, building and testing mockups, prototype evaluation, and construction of a high quality functioning alpha prototype. Over the course of one semester, our team of 20 students endeavored to develop a new product within the theme of danger. We started from hundreds of concepts and gradually honed in on the concept of an auto-retracting utility knife: TALON.</p>

<p>Our team showcased TALON to an audience of over 40,000 people in December 2019 during the final presentations of the semester.</p>
