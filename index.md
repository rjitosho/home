<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm a graduate student at Stanford University, and I work on projects spanning motion planning, mobile systems, and soft robotics. I am co-advised by Allison Okamura, director of the CHARM Lab, and Zac Manchester, director of the REX Lab. I completed my undergraduate degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I worked on projects in robotics and solar-powered electric vehicles. As a researcher and engineer, I seek to be involved in applied projects to develop impactful solutions for society.</p>
